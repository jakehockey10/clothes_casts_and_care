        Hello! My name is Lindsey and I am an Ambassador Girl Scout in Colorado!
        I'm currently pursuing my Gold Award, the most prestigious award in all
        of Girl Scouts. To do this, I have started a project called "Clothes,
        Casts, and Care" dedicated to finding and creating clothing options to fit
        those wearing hip spica casts. I have partnered with Children's Hospital
        in Aurora, Colorado and Shriners Hospital for Children in Salt Lake City,
        Utah to provide the patients there with clothing to wear while they are
        in heir hip spica casts. I have also created this website so every family
        can find clothing options to fit their needs.
